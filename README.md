## Statistical Summary

# Question 1: How well do vaccines prevent total ICU and hospital patients?

* Question 1 Findings: Rising vaccination rates negatively correlate with a decrease in both ICU and Hospitalization rates. However, between September 2021 and June 2022, there is a spike of ICU patients, which can be inferred as an outbreak of the new variant. A more drastic drop and spike occurs for hospitalization rates, implying that vaccines are extremely effective in flattening the hospitalization curve, but only if it is the same covid variant.

# Question 2:  How does the median age of individuals affect their hospitalization admission and total deaths?

* Question 2 Findings: The scatter plot shows that median age positively correlates with hospitalization and ICU admissions as well as with total number of deaths. Essentially this is describing, the older you are, the more likely you are to be hospitalized from COVID-19. As a measure of how accurate this data is, you can see that the standard deviation between the median age and ICU patients is quite high. This suggests that the data points are more spread out from the mean which can mean the data is not very trustworthy. However, the small standard error suggests confidence in the estimated standard deviation. The same goes for the total deaths from COVID-19. The graph is showing, the older you are, the more likely you are to die from COVID-19.
