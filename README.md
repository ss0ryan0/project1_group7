## Statistical Summary

# Question 1: How well do vaccines prevent total ICU and hospital patients?

* Question 1 Findings: Rising vaccination rates negatively correlate with a decrease in both ICU and Hospitalization rates. However, between September 2021 and June 2022, there is a spike of ICU patients, which can be inferred as an outbreak of the new variant. A more drastic drop and spike occurs for hospitalization rates, implying that vaccines are extremely effective in flattening the hospitalization curve, but only if it is the same covid variant.

# Question 2:  How does the median age of individuals affect their hospitalization admission and total deaths?

* Question 2 Findings: The scatter plot shows that median age positively correlates with hospitalization and ICU admissions as well as with total number of deaths. Essentially this is describing, the older you are, the more likely you are to be hospitalized from COVID-19. As a measure of how accurate this data is, you can see that the standard deviation between the median age and ICU patients is quite high. This suggests that the data points are more spread out from the mean which can mean the data is not very trustworthy. However, the small standard error suggests confidence in the estimated standard deviation.
* The same goes for the total deaths from COVID-19. The graph is showing, the older you are, the more likely you are to die from COVID-19. Again, you can see that the standard deviation between the total deaths is quite high. Again, this suggests that the data points are more spread out from the mean which might mean our data is very unreliable. Now we have a moderate standard error. This could mean that there is substantial variability in our data.
* It goes to show that there is some sort of correlation where as the median age increases, the more likely you are to suffer from the consequences of COVID-19.

# Question 3: How do Smoking Habits and Elderly Rates affect Hospitalization and ICU Numbers?

* For Smokers and Age, the x-axis of smokers and age is just the share of the population of people who smoke or are old

* Most of the countries have high vaccination rates, making vaccines contribute the least to changes in the curve once they have been introduced.
* As the amount of Male and female smokers increase, the greater potential for a greater amount of hospitalization. However, female smokers of any amount seem to be more likely to have higher hospitalization rates. It can be inferred that pregnancy and breast-cancer could be potential hypotheses. This wide potential for hospitalization can explain the high Standard Deviation for both male and female smokers.
* As the amount of people aged over 65 and 70 increase, the greater potential for a greater amount of hospitalization. However, when Aged Over 70 is 0, that shows the highest concentration of the various amount of Hospitalized patients, possibly due to age-related sickness.
