# some parameters that I wanted to compare
* hospitalized patients over time based on location
  * look for the increase and decrease of patients over time with and without the vaccine

* hospitalized patients vs icu patients
  * want to see if there was a decrease in icu patients over time (especially when the vaccine was implimented)
  * also want to see if there is a relationship between icu patients vs overall hospitalized patients (like the percentage of each over time)
 
* smokers/cardiovasc/diabetic patients that are vaccinated vs death rate
* * i basically want to see all the people with all three risk factors if they got the vaccine or not, if so i want to see their death rate. this would be interesting to see because this could show that the vaccine is helpful to people and it is important to get if you are at risk of dying from covid
